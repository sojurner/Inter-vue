##### You have an array of integers and for each index you want to find the product of every integer execpt the integer at that index.

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products

###### Example:

Input: `[1, 7, 3, 4]`
Output `[84, 12, 28, 21]`

```
[7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]
```

\*\* Cannot use division
